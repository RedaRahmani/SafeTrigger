# CatalystGuard Web App

> Stub for Milestone 0 – placeholder for the web frontend.

The web app will provide:

- **Dashboard**: View policies, open tickets, execution history
- **Ticket Builder**: Create sealed conditional intents with commitment hashes
- **Policy Manager**: Configure and update policy parameters
- **Compliance Gate**: DFlow Proof KYC verification flow
- **Geo-blocking**: Jurisdiction-based access control

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- `@solana/wallet-adapter` for wallet connection
- `@catalyst-guard/sdk` for on-chain interactions
- TailwindCSS for styling
